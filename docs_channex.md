Open Channel API
Details on how to connect your OTA, booking engine or channel manager as a channel on Channex.

Introduction
To connect your platform to Channex we have provided a Push API so you can get real time changes of Availability, Prices and Restrictions and push bookings to Channex. Please see the information below on how to integrate. As always we offer full developer support, just email support@channex.io if you have any questions.

We will cover the next key points:

Endpoint to test connection between your side and Channex

Endpoint to expose mapping details from your side to Channex

Endpoint to receive inventory changes from Channex at your side

How to push bookings from your side to Channex

Endpoint to request Full Sync from Channex to your side

Create a Staging Server Account
To get started you need to sign up to the Channex staging server and create a test property at staging.channex.io

Loading...
staging.channex.io
Once you have made your account you just need to make a test property, with some rooms and rates. You can find some help files on creating that here:

Channel / OTA Eligibility and Process
At Channex we allow any channel to connect, be assured if you want to be a Channex Channel you will be certified if your technical integration passes all our testing.

You just need to create a test property with some rooms and rates, then create a "Open Channel" so you can self integrate.

If you want to get in touch with us to make sure please send an email to evan@channex.io

Create the Open Channel
Once you have created your test property go to channels and click Add New button


The "Open Channel" is our way to let you self connect as a channel instead of requiring any manual assistance from Channex. It's also flexible allowing you to integrate from any domain or test server before you certify.

Channel: This should be set to "Open Channel"

Group: What property group you want to use, if test account only one should show here

Title: This is just a text description of your connection, either property name or some other text is acceptable and not used apart from the UI

Property: Select you test property you have created

Connection Settings
Endpoint: Enter the endpoint where you will receive our api calls.

API Key: Your API key to identify Channex api push. By default we will send this API Key as a header api_key. Can be empty.

Hotel Code: Your hotel code to identify which property on your side. This will be your property ID.

API Endpoints
Requirements
To implement the connection between your service and Channex you should implement several API endpoints, these will provide information about the connected property from your side and / or receive changes that has happened at the property state.

All API endpoints should be placed at same level and should have predefined names:
https://your-website.com/api/mapping_details/

At this example, the part written in bold (https://your-website.com/api/), can be custom and we expect to get this value as endpoint in the Open Channel configuration.

mapping_details/ part is predefined by Channex. Endpoint should end with a / symbol.

As result, we  expect to see the next API endpoints:

test_connection

mapping_details

changes

Example:

https://your-website.com/api/mapping_details/

https://your-website.com/api/test_connection/

https://your-website.com/api/changes/

API Endpoints can be protected by an API Key authorisation. If you choose this way, we will use a header with name api-key.

Please check the header for authorisation at your server side to make sure the request comes from Channex.

Test Connection endpoint
This endpoint will be used to check the connection, using a hotel code which is provided by the user (hotel_code). Channex will send GET request to this endpoint and expect to receive a successful result.

We expect to see GET endpoint protected by API Key authentication. Endpoint should allow a GET argument with hotel_code

Query


Copy
GET your_site.com/api/test_connection/?hotel_code={HOTEL_CODE}
Expected Response


Copy
{
  "success": true
}  
Expected Response Status Code: 200 OK

Mapping details endpoint
This endpoint will be used to get information about Room Types and Rate Plans from your side. This will allow the user to map in the Channex interface.


Mapping Screen at Channex.io
We expect to see the GET endpoint protected by API Key authentication. Endpoint should allow a GET argument with a hotel_code and return room and rate details for mapping.

Query


Copy
GET your_site.com/api/mapping_details/?hotel_code={HOTEL_CODE}
Expected Response

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
Expected Response Status Code: 200 OK

Field Description
room_types
List of room types available at your side for mapping. Should contain id, title and rate_plans

rate_plans
List of rate plans associated with room type available at your side for mapping. Should contain id, title, sell_mode, max_persons, currency, read_only.

sell_mode
Flag to show how room is sell at your side. Can have one of 2 options: per_room or per_person. If rate plan is set as per_room Channex.io will provide updates only for max_persons occupancy. If rate plan is set as per_person channex.io will provide updates for each mapped occupancy (from 1 to max_persons).

max_persons
Max count of guests allowed by rate plan. Integer value greater than 0.

currency
ISO 4217 3-alpha currency code of rate plan.

read_only
If your rate plan does not allow updates, but can be sold at 3rd party side, you can pass it with flag read_only equal to true. In that case, we will allow user to map this rate plan but not provide updates for this rate plan.

Changes API
Each time Channex catches any changes at the property state associated with Rate Plans or Room Types mapped to your system, we will generate a changes message and send it to changes endpoint at your side via POST request.

Min Stay Requirements

Does your system accept Min Stay Arrival & Min Stay Through? If you only support one please get in touch with us for workaround.

If you support only 1 type of min stay, the final minimum stay field will be "min_stay" instead of arrival or through.

We expect to see the POST endpoint protected by API Key authentication. Query will contain JSON message with changes.

Room Type (room_type_id at your system)

Date From (date_from) represented as Date at ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format
